# Note: Keeping native android code if it was manually modified, 
# but usually Expo's android/ folder is generated.
# In this project, we edited many files in mobile/android/app/src/main/java/com/gaosiwem/mobile/
# so we should probably NOT ignore the whole android/ folder if we want to keep those changes.
# I'll be selective.
